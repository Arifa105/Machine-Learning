# Project Description:
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict salaries based on years of experience using linear regression. The goal was to analyze the relationship between experience and salary, providing insights that could assist both job seekers and employers.

## Steps Undertaken:
## 1.	Data Collection:
    I gathered a dataset containing employee salaries and corresponding years of experience. The dataset included various fields such as experience (in years) and salary (in USD).
## 2.	Data Preprocessing:
         o	Data Cleaning:
                  Ensured the dataset was free of missing values and outliers.
         o	Feature Selection:
                 Focused on 'Years of Experience' as the primary feature to predict 'Salary'.
## 3.	Data Splitting:
o	Divided the dataset into training and testing sets, using an 80/20 split. The training set was used to fit the model, while the testing set was used to evaluate its performance.
## 4.	Model Fitting:
o	Implemented a linear regression model using a suitable library (e.g., scikit-learn).
o	Trained the model on the training dataset to learn the relationship between experience and salary.
## 5.	Data Visualization:
o	Created plots to visualize the relationship between experience and salary. This included scatter plots of the training data with the fitted regression line, helping to illustrate the model's predictions.
## 6.	Model Evaluation:
o	Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values on the testing dataset.
o	Conducted residual analysis to ensure the model's assumptions were satisfied.
## 7.	Prediction of Unknown Values:
o	Used the trained model to predict salaries for unknown values of experience. This involved inputting new experience values into the model to forecast corresponding salaries.
